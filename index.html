  <p>I'm convinced that to be a good makeup artist you need to love people, be able to listen to them, have a positive attitude, take into account not only the external features of a person, but also her inner world - to create such a makeup in which the client will be psychologically comfortable.<br><b> These are the principles that guide my work.</b> Each makeup for me is a special creation, with which I give life to a unique image, harmonious and attractive.</p>

  I firmly believe that the concept of "appearance flaw" does not exist. At least for me as a makeup artist.<br>There are features that are interesting to focus on. There are features from which it is interesting to divert attention at the expense of other features. There are benefits. <br>That is why the right faces are the most boring, so to speak. Fortunately, nature almost does not make them 😉<br>
